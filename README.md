## Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The predictive model is based on historical data of resale flat transactions and assists both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

# Motivation
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and accurately estimating the resale value of a flat can be challenging due to various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A predictive model can help overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors.

# Project Scope
The project involves the following tasks:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect and preprocess a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB).
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset and create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate regression machine learning model and train it on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics.
Streamlit Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat and get a resale price prediction.
Deployment on Render: Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible online.
Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure accurate predictions and functionality.

# Data Source
